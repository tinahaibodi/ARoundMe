## Inspiration
What if you could bring your textbook to life? With the rise of technology - we finally can. solAR was created to help spike the interest of space in young adults by started in the classroom. 

## What it does
This app when projected on thin air, illustrates the presence of the Solar system, outer space particles. You can also see speed of revolution of planets and travel in a rocket to the outer space. The iOS application helps simulate flying in space to help spike interest for children wishing to pursue careers in STEM related fields. 

## How we built it
ARKit and Scenekit on Xcode platform with Objective-C as programming language.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into many challenges trying to integrate ARKit with an iOS environment and CocoaPods/Alamofire because since it's fairly new there is limited documentation about navigating through bugs while developing in Objective-C. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning how to transition from Swift to Objective-C and back. Learning to develop iOS applications with AR, contemplating benefits of AR vs. VR. Finally understanding the importance of Cocoapods in iOS development. 

## What's next for solAR
We would like to add dynamic dropdown menus that respond to touch, in addition to Amazon Polly for a full integrated classroom experience.
